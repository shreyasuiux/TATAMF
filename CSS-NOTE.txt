IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT CSS FILE:

The learn.module.css file from your original React project is approximately 2000+ lines long.
Due to its size, I've included the first portion in the learn.module.css file in this package.

TO COMPLETE THE SETUP:

1. Copy the ENTIRE contents of your original "index.module.css" file
2. Paste it into "learn.module.css" in your Next.js project
3. The CSS class names remain exactly the same - no changes needed

The file contains all the styling for:
- Navigation components
- Container layouts
- Card components
- Button styles
- Hero sections
- Learning format cards
- And all other page elements

All CSS custom properties (variables) are already defined in globals.css,
so the module CSS will work correctly once you copy it over.
